    <h1>Jack Strickland's Assignment 1: Blink!</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="red-panda.jpg" />
      <p>Prompt: Create a circuit with 3 or more LED's where each can blink independently.

        Firmware: 
        // Arduino code for blinking 3 LEDs independently in a sequence
// Define the Arduino digital pin connected to the first red LED
int redLED1 = 8;

// Define the Arduino digital pin connected to the white LED
int whiteLED = 10;

// Define the Arduino digital pin connected to the second red LED
int redLED2 = 12;

// The setup function runs when the program initiates
void setup() {

  // Configure the first red LED pin as an OUTPUT
  pinMode(redLED1, OUTPUT);

  // Configure the white LED pin as an OUTPUT
  pinMode(whiteLED, OUTPUT);

  // Configure the second red LED pin as an OUTPUT
  pinMode(redLED2, OUTPUT);
}

//The loop function will run repeatedly indefinitely 
void loop() {

  // Turn ON the first red LED
  digitalWrite(redLED1, HIGH);
  // LED stays on for 500 ms
  delay(500);
  // Turn LED off and move to next one
  digitalWrite(redLED1, LOW);

  // Turn ON the white LED
  digitalWrite(whiteLED, HIGH);
  // LED stays on for 500 ms
  delay(500);
  // Turn LED off and move to next one
  digitalWrite(whiteLED, LOW);

  // Turn ON the second red LED
  digitalWrite(redLED2, HIGH);
  // LED stays on for 500 ms
  delay(500);
  // Turn LED off and move to next one
  digitalWrite(redLED2, LOW);

  // Pause before repeating the sequence
  delay(500);
}

Additional Questions:
1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.

2: How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?
14 digital pins x 10 mA, requires 140 mA
3: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?
T = 1/60 = 16.7 ms
4: Did you use AI tools in completing this assignment?
I used generative AI in further understanding how to implement "digitalWrite" and choosing the correct pins.
